# Example Plugin - vatSys Integration with vStrips 
This Plugin integrates vatSys and vStrips to provide a solution similar to the INTAS electronic strip system used at airfields in Australia.  As vStrips is a UK based system, customisation is limited and the development of the plugin and configuration of vStrips bays, strips etc is ongoing.
